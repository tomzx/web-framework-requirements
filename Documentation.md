# Documentation

In order to document each and every section in a consistent fashion, a certain format was adopted, similar to the one used in the book [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

* **Name:** A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the service.
* **Intent:** A description of the goal behind the service and the reason for using it.
* **Also Known As:** Other names for the service.
* **Collaborators:** A listing of the services that may collaborate with the service.
* **Collaboration:** A description of how the collaborators interact with the service.
* **Implementation:** A description of an implementation of the service.
* **Known Uses:** Examples of real usages of the service.
* **Related Services:** Other services that have some relationship with the service; discussion of the differences between the service and similar services.
